# NumTel

This client-side tool converts your phone number into a memorizable word when it is possible. It doesn't work well if you have many zeros and ones in the number because there is no associated letter for them.


## Install

- Install NodeJS
- Run `npm install -g coffeescript uglify-js`
- Execute `compile.bat` (as much as needed, press Enter when the individual tasks are finished)
- Open `index.html`
- Enjoy
